    question: "How does a cognitive team actually work?",
    answer: "Think of it as your team's digital twin that handles execution work. It learns your workflows, integrates with your tools, and automates repetitive tasks - freeing your people for strategic work. No code, no complex setup.",
    icon: "ðŸ¤–",
    iconPosition: "left" as const,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How long does implementation take?",
    answer: "Most teams see their first cognitive agent live within 2 weeks. Full deployment across a function (like sales or ops) typically takes 4-6 weeks. We handle the heavy lifting - you just tell us what's eating your team's time.",
    icon: "âš¡",
    iconPosition: "right" as const,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What if my team doesn't know how to work with AI?",
    answer: "They don't need to. Your cognitive team works in the background through existing tools - Slack, email, your CRM. Your people keep doing what they do best, just with 80% less busywork.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Is our data secure?",
    answer: "Enterprise-grade security, SOC 2 compliant, encrypted at rest and in transit. Your data stays yours - we never train models on client data or share it. Most deployments run in your own cloud environment.",
    icon: "ðŸ”’",
    iconPosition: "left" as const,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How much does it cost compared to hiring?",
    answer: "A cognitive team member costs roughly what you'd pay for 2-3 coffee subscriptions per month. Compare that to hiring - no recruitment costs, no benefits, no turnover. Most clients see positive ROI within 30 days.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What happens if the AI makes a mistake?",
    answer: "Human oversight is built in. Cognitive agents flag uncertainty, escalate edge cases, and learn from corrections. Critical decisions always go to humans. Think of it as a very capable junior team member - fast, reliable, but supervised.",
    icon: "âœ…",
    iconPosition: "right" as const,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can it integrate with our existing tools?",
    answer: "If you use it, we probably integrate with it - Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Gmail, Notion, Airtable, your custom CRM. We connect to your stack via APIs, no rip-and-replace needed.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What's the ROI? How do you measure success?",
    answer: "We track three things: hours saved (typically 40-60% per person), output increase (2-3x more work), and morale improvement (measured via team surveys). Most clients recoup investment in month one and scale from there.",
    icon: "ðŸ“Š",
    iconPosition: "left" as const,
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Do you replace jobs or augment teams?",
    answer: "Augment. We've never seen a client reduce headcount - they redeploy people to higher-value work. Think of it as freeing your strategists from being buried in spreadsheets and emails.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "What if we want to start small?",
    answer: "Perfect. We recommend starting with one pain point - like sales research or customer onboarding. Prove value in 30 days, then expand. No massive upfront commitment, no vendor lock-in.",
    icon: "ðŸš€",
    iconPosition: "right" as const,
